# train-scheduler
Had trouble with the authentication from Firebase, had it working with proper permissions then got an error saying 
"permission denied" when I console logged errors since items were displaying on the page. Switched the capabilites to "editor" 
and had it working, came up with the same error towards submission. 
Not sure if the issue is with my Firebase authentication or the fact that I had altered the sign-in from a google account to 
an anyonymous user so that (for the time being) I could see the code without signing in. There were intial errors with the 
"add train" and it not emptying previous entries even after the refresh and clearing the cache.
